    "Nominal Data: This type represents categories without a natural order.\n",
    "Examples :\n",
    "Types of fruits (apple, banana, orange)\n",
    "Colors (red, blue, green)\n",
    "Gender (male, female, non-binary)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Data: This type represents categories with a meaningful order, but the differences between the categories are not uniform. \n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "Survey responses (satisfied, neutral, dissatisfied)\n",
    "Educational levels (high school, bachelor's, master's, PhD)\n",
    "Movie ratings (poor, fair, good, excellent)\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantitative Data\n",
    "Quantitative data refers to numerical information that can be measured and quantified. It can be divided into two subtypes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval Data: This type has meaningful differences between values, but there is no true zero point. Examples :\n",

    "Calendar years (the year 2000 is not “twice as much” as 1000)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ratio Data: This type has all the properties of interval data, but it also includes a true zero point, allowing for meaningful comparisons. \n",

    "c. There are no outliers that could skew the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median\n",
    "The median is the middle value of a dataset when it is ordered from least to greatest. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "dataset: 3, 5, 7, 8, 10\n",
    "median = 7 (the middle value)\n",
    "For an even dataset: 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12\n",

    "When to Use:\n",

    "c. When dealing with ordinal data, where mean calculation isn't suitable.\n",

    "3. Mode\n",
    "The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all if no number repeats.\n",

    "When to Use:\n",

    "Importance of Variance and Standard Deviation\n",
    "a. Variance provides a measure of how spread out the data points are, but it is in squared units, which can make interpretation less intuitive.\n",
    "b. Standard Deviation is more commonly used because it is in the same units as the data, making it easier to understand and relate to the original data context."
